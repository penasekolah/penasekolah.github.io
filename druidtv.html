                                            Underline  the indirect objects in the following paragraphs!Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence</a>

She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes.

1.	Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.
2.	But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.
3.	Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late.

1.	Even the most seasoned and savvy clinician views lupus warily, considering it one of the most bewildering diseases in all of medicine. This situation should not be a surprise since the manifestations of lupus are dizzying in their variety and exasperating in their subtlety. Furthermore, although lupus has been at the heart of immunology research for decades, investigators have yet to figure out its basis. Lupus represents a blatant violat-ion of the most fundamental laws of the immune system. Nevertheless, the disturbances that dangerously turn self into non-self remain totally obscure.
2.	The image of lupus adds to the confusion, although lupus actually has two competing images. These images, despite their differences, represent lupus's trademarks, its 'brand identity' so to speak. Lupus got its name from the wolf; its usual symbol, however, is the butterfly. I doubt that there are any two species as unlike one another in attitude, color, and emotional resonance as the wolf and the butterfly. Even if a misnomer, the word schizophrenic rightly describes this fierce battle of identity.
3.	Branding a specific disease with the image of a creature comes with its hazards, and efforts to link a disease with a member of the animal kingdom are, in fact, unusual. Among the few associations that come to mind are icthyosis to describe skin that looks like fish scales; leonine facies, the lion-like visage of patients with lepromatous leprosy; and elephantiasis, the thickened skin and bulging extremities from filariasis.</a>

Halloween
Many of the ancient people of Europe marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter by celebrating a holiday in late autumn. The most important of these holidays that influence later Halloween customs was Samhain, a holiday observed by the ancient Celts, a tribal people who inhabited most of Western and Central Europe in the first millennium BC. Among the Celts, Samhain marked the end of one year and the beginning of the next. It was one of four Celtic holidays linked to important transitions in the annual cycle of seasons.
Samhain began at sundown on October 31 and extended into the following day. According to the Celtic pagan religion, known as Druidism, the spirits of those who had died in the preceding year roamed the earth on Samhain evening. The Celts sought to ward off these spirits with offerings of food and drink. The Celts also built bonfires at sacred hilltop sites and perfomed rituals, often involving human and animal sacrifices, to honor Druid deities.
                In Britain, Romans blended local Samhain customs with their own pagan harvest festival honoring Pomona, goddess of fruit trees. Some scholars have suggested that the game of bobbing for apples drives from this Roman association of the holiday with fruit.
                In British folklore, small magical being known as fairies became associated with Halloween mischief. The jack-o’-lantern, originally carved from a large turnip rather than a pumpkin, originated in medieval Scotland. Various methods of predicting the future, especially concerning matters of romance and marriage, were also prominent features of Halloween throughout the British Isles.
                Between the 15th and 17th centuries. Europe was seized by a hysterical fear of witches, leading to the persecution of thousands in innocent women. Witches were thought to ride flying brooms and to assume the form of black cats. These images of witches soon joined other European superstitions as symbols of Halloween.</a>

She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</a>

She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest.

Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late.

                        terjemahannya:Garisbawahi objek tidak langsung di paragraf berikut!<br /><br />Morg adalah salib. Dia lebih dari sekadar salib, dia sangat marah. Dia telah dipilih untuk memikirkan adik laki-lakinya, lagi. Biasanya dia sangat menyukainya, karena dia menemukan kakinya yang pendek, mengoceh dengan cara yang membuatnya tertawa, tetapi hari ini ada sesuatu yang lebih menyenangkan terjadi. Orang-orang itu bersiap untuk pergi berburu. Tidak ada perburuan selama berbulan-bulan. Pertama ada terlalu banyak hujan dan kemudian ada terlalu banyak pekerjaan dengan panen. Tapi sekarang gandum sudah masuk dan biji-bijian itu semuanya disimpan di dalam lubang. Druid ada di sini, membawa berkah dari para dewa dan obat-obatan untuk penduduk desa. Jadi, sang ketua memutuskan bahwa sudah waktunya. Di luar para pria sedang berkumpul dan Druid sedang melantunkan. Morg ingin berada di sana.<br /><br />Tapi Morg tidak diizinkan pergi. Dia bahkan tidak diizinkan untuk menonton. Kakaknya tidak sehat. Dia memiliki roh jahat di dadanya yang membuatnya batuk dan batuk. Dia harus tetap hangat, dan untuk melakukan itu, dia harus berada di dalam pondok. Karena itu, ketika ibunya mengambil air, Morg harus tinggal di pondok juga. Gelap di dalam pondok. Suatu kegelapan yang hangat, kaya, tebal, hanya diterangi oleh cahaya dari api yang membakar di tengah ruangan. Kemudian, api akan dibangun sehingga api akan menjilat kuali hitam bulat dan memanaskan rebusan untuk makan malam, tetapi untuk saat ini rumput telah diletakkan di kayu gelondongan. Api akan tetap panas dan hidup, tetapi tidak perlu diberi makan. Morg tahu bahwa kebakaran sama rakusnya dengan serigala yang dia dengar melolong di hutan pada malam hari.<br /><br />Morg bisa mencium bau api dan baunya sama familiernya dengan bau ibunya. Dia bisa mengendus dan mengatakan pada suatu saat apakah keluarga membakar cabang-cabang abu atau hazel, hawthorn atau elm coppiced. Untuk Morg, itu bau rumah. Cahaya dari api menyinari wajah bocah lelaki yang berbaring di sebelahnya tertidur di atas selimut. Morg menyapu lantai di sekitarnya dengan kejam. Setiap remah atau daging yang dibuang akan membuat makanan untuk tikus, dan ibunya membenci tikus. Morg memutuskan bahwa hari ini dia membenci ibunya. Dia tahu ibunya cemas tentang batuk karena kakaknya batuk dengan cara yang sama sebelum dia meninggal. Itu tidak menghentikan Morg dari menggumamkan kutukan melawan kejahatan yang membuatnya di dalam gubuk. Saat dia mengatakannya, dia berharap dia bisa menelan kembali kata-katanya, tetapi sudah terlambat. Dia melihat sekeliling dengan khawatir. Mungkin tidak ada yang mendengarnya. Dia melantunkan niat baik akan mantra, dan menyilangkan jari-jarinya.<br /><br />Di luar, ia mendengar tanduk berburu, keras dan tajam melintasi desa. Morg beringsut menuju ambang pintu. Dia bisa melihat cahaya melalui celah di papan, tapi itu tidak cukup. Dia membuka pintu sedikit. Mungkin dia bisa menontonnya dari sini? Dia mungkin bisa melihat sekilas apa yang sedang terjadi. Tapi dia tidak bisa melihat apa pun. Pagar yang disimpan di babi menghalangi pandangannya. Dia membuka pintu lebih lebar, dan embusan angin dingin mencambuknya dari tangannya. Itu menabrak tabrakan di sisi gubuk. Di belakangnya api berderak menjadi hidup dan bayi itu membuka matanya. Morg tidak memperhatikan. Dia berjuang untuk mengendalikan pintu. Dia menjepitnya dengan batu, sehingga masih terlihat tertutup pada pandangan pertama. Dia meluncur keluar dan menyeberang ke pojok pagar babi.<br />

1.	Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.
2.	But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.
3.	Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late.

4.	Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough.

1.	Even the most seasoned and savvy clinician views lupus warily, considering it one of the most bewildering diseases in all of medicine. This situation should not be a surprise since the manifestations of lupus are dizzying in their variety and exasperating in their subtlety. Furthermore, although lupus has been at the heart of immunology research for decades, investigators have yet to figure out its basis. Lupus represents a blatant violat-ion of the most fundamental laws of the immune system. Nevertheless, the disturbances that dangerously turn self into non-self remain totally obscure.
2.	The image of lupus adds to the confusion, although lupus actually has two competing images. These images, despite their differences, represent lupus's trademarks, its 'brand identity' so to speak. Lupus got its name from the wolf; its usual symbol, however, is the butterfly. I doubt that there are any two species as unlike one another in attitude, color, and emotional resonance as the wolf and the butterfly. Even if a misnomer, the word schizophrenic rightly describes this fierce battle of identity.

Halloween
Many of the ancient people of Europe marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter by celebrating a holiday in late autumn. The most important of these holidays that influence later Halloween customs was Samhain, a holiday observed by the ancient Celts, a tribal people who inhabited most of Western and Central Europe in the first millennium BC. Among the Celts, Samhain marked the end of one year and the beginning of the next. It was one of four Celtic holidays linked to important transitions in the annual cycle of seasons.
Samhain began at sundown on October 31 and extended into the following day. According to the Celtic pagan religion, known as Druidism, the spirits of those who had died in the preceding year roamed the earth on Samhain evening. The Celts sought to ward off these spirits with offerings of food and drink. The Celts also built bonfires at sacred hilltop sites and perfomed rituals, often involving human and animal sacrifices, to honor Druid deities.
                In Britain, Romans blended local Samhain customs with their own pagan harvest festival honoring Pomona, goddess of fruit trees. Some scholars have suggested that the game of bobbing for apples drives from this Roman association of the holiday with fruit.
                In British folklore, small magical being known as fairies became associated with Halloween mischief. The jack-o’-lantern, originally carved from a large turnip rather than a pumpkin, originated in medieval Scotland. Various methods of predicting the future, especially concerning matters of romance and marriage, were also prominent features of Halloween throughout the British Isles.
                Between the 15th and 17th centuries. Europe was seized by a hysterical fear of witches, leading to the persecution of thousands in innocent women. Witches were thought to ride flying brooms and to assume the form of black cats. These images of witches soon joined other European superstitions as symbols of Halloween.</h2><br />

Yang paling penting dari liburan ini yang mempengaruhi kemudian kebiasaan Halloween adalah Samhain, liburan diamati oleh Celtic kuno, orang-orang suku yang mendiami sebagian besar Eropa Barat dan Tengah pada milenium pertama SM. Di antara Celtic, Samhain menandai akhir dari satu tahun dan awal berikutnya. Itu salah satu dari empat liburan Celtic terkait dengan transisi penting dalam siklus tahunan musim.<br />Samhain mulai saat matahari terbenam pada 31 Oktober dan diperpanjang ke hari berikutnya. Menurut agama pagan Celtic, yang dikenal sebagai Druidism, roh-roh orang yang meninggal di tahun sebelumnya berkeliaran di bumi pada Samhain malam. Celtic berusaha untuk menangkal roh-roh dengan persembahan makanan dan minuman. Celtic juga dibangun api unggun di situs puncak bukit suci dan sedian ritual, sering melibatkan pengorbanan manusia dan hewan, untuk menghormati dewa Druid.<br />Di Inggris, Roma dicampur kebiasaan Samhain lokal dengan festival pagan panen mereka sendiri menghormati Pomona, dewi pohon buah-buahan. Beberapa ahli telah menyarankan bahwa permainan angguk untuk apel drive dari asosiasi Romawi ini dari liburan dengan buah.<br />Dalam cerita rakyat Inggris, makhluk ajaib kecil yang dikenal sebagai peri menjadi terkait dengan kenakalan Halloween. Jack-o'-lantern, awalnya diukir dari lobak besar daripada labu, berasal abad pertengahan Skotlandia. Berbagai metode memprediksi masa depan, terutama mengenai hal-hal romantis dan pernikahan, juga fitur yang menonjol dari Halloween di seluruh Kepulauan Inggris.<br />Antara abad 15 dan 17. Eropa ditangkap oleh ketakutan histeris penyihir, yang mengarah ke penganiayaan ribu pada wanita yang tidak bersalah. Penyihir dianggap naik terbang sapu dan untuk mengasumsikan bentuk kucing hitam. Gambar-gambar ini dari penyihir segera bergabung takhayul Eropa lainnya sebagai simbol Halloween.<br />

Not all sentence has an indirect object. The indirect object can appear only if there is a direct object. Generally, the indirect object is the recipient of the direct object. A direct object is an object which refers to someone or something that receives the verb's action.<br />The direct object also can appear only if the verb is a transitive verb.<br /><br />For example, I give him a book.<br />The word "I" is the subject, "give" is the verb, "A book" is the direct object, and "him" is the indirect object. <br /><br />So, here's the indirect object of the text above:<br />- From the god<br />- For the villagers.<br /><br />Detil tambahan:<br />Kelas: SMA:<br />Pelajaran: Bahasa inggris<br />Kategori: Indirect object<br />

Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.
2.	But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.
3.	Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.
4.	Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</h2><br />

Orang-orang itu bersiap untuk pergi berburu. Tidak ada perburuan selama berbulan-bulan. Pertama ada terlalu banyak hujan dan kemudian ada terlalu banyak pekerjaan dengan panen. Tapi sekarang gandum sudah masuk dan biji-bijian itu semuanya disimpan di dalam lubang. Druid ada di sini, membawa berkah dari para dewa dan obat-obatan untuk penduduk desa. Jadi, sang ketua memutuskan bahwa sudah waktunya. Di luar para pria sedang berkumpul dan Druid sedang melantunkan. Morg ingin berada di sana. 2. Tetapi Morg tidak diijinkan pergi. Dia bahkan tidak diizinkan untuk menonton. Kakaknya tidak sehat. Dia memiliki roh jahat di dadanya yang membuatnya batuk dan batuk. Dia harus tetap hangat, dan untuk melakukan itu, dia harus berada di dalam pondok. Karena itu, ketika ibunya mengambil air, Morg harus tinggal di pondok juga. Gelap di dalam pondok. Suatu kegelapan yang hangat, kaya, tebal, hanya diterangi oleh cahaya dari api yang membakar di tengah ruangan. Kemudian, api akan dibangun sehingga api akan menjilat kuali hitam bulat dan memanaskan rebusan untuk makan malam, tetapi untuk saat ini rumput telah diletakkan di kayu gelondongan. Api akan tetap panas dan hidup, tetapi tidak perlu diberi makan. Morg tahu bahwa kebakaran sama rakusnya dengan serigala yang dia dengar melolong di hutan pada malam hari. 3. Morg bisa mencium bau api dan baunya sama akrabnya dengan bau ibunya. Dia bisa mengendus dan mengatakan pada suatu saat apakah keluarga membakar abu cabang atau hazel, hawthorn atau elm berhurung. Untuk Morg, itu bau rumah. Cahaya dari api menyinari wajah bocah lelaki yang berbaring di sebelahnya tertidur di atas selimut. Morg menyapu lantai di sekitarnya dengan kejam. Setiap remah atau daging yang dibuang akan membuat makanan untuk tikus, dan ibunya membenci tikus. Morg memutuskan bahwa hari ini dia membenci ibunya. Dia tahu ibunya cemas tentang batuk karena kakaknya batuk dengan cara yang sama sebelum dia meninggal. Itu tidak menghentikan Morg dari menggumamkan kutukan melawan kejahatan yang membuatnya di dalam gubuk. Saat dia mengatakannya, dia berharap dia bisa menelan kembali kata-katanya, tetapi sudah terlambat. Dia melihat sekeliling dengan khawatir. Mungkin tidak ada yang mendengarnya. Dia melantunkan niat baik akan mantra, dan menyilangkan jari-jarinya. 4. Di luar, dia mendengar tanduk berburu, keras dan tajam melintasi desa. Morg beringsut menuju ambang pintu. Dia bisa melihat cahaya melalui celah di papan, tapi itu tidak cukup. Dia membuka pintu sedikit. Mungkin dia bisa menontonnya dari sini? Dia mungkin bisa melihat sekilas apa yang sedang terjadi. Tapi dia tidak bisa melihat apa pun. Pagar yang disimpan di babi menghalangi pandangannya. Dia membuka pintu lebih lebar, dan embusan angin dingin mencambuknya dari tangannya. Itu menabrak tabrakan di sisi gubuk. Di belakangnya api berderak menjadi hidup dan bayi itu membuka matanya. Morg tidak memperhatikan. Dia berjuang untuk mengendalikan pintu. Dia menjepitnya dengan batu, sehingga masih terlihat tertutup pada pandangan pertama. Dia meluncur keluar dan menyeberang ke pojok pagar babi.</p><br />
