                                            what is the main idea of Functional organization is efficient, but there are two standard criticisms. Firstly,  people are usually more concerned with the success of their department than that  of  the  company,  so  there  are  permanent  battles  between,  for  example,  finance  and  marketing,  or  marketing  and  production,  which  have  incompatible  goal.   Secondly, separating functions is unlikely to encourage innovation.  </a>

                        I guess that's because The Battle of Surabaya is one of the most memorable and biggest one.

                        <p><strong>JAWAB:</strong></p><p><strong>The Battle of Surabaya (Historical Recount text)
</strong></p><p>Indonesia Had gone through many battles why do you think the date of the Battle of Surabaya is used as a momentum to commemorate our hero's contribution?
</p><p><strong>Battle of Surabaya provoked Indonesian and international mass to rally for the country’s independence which made this battle especially important for Indonesian national revolution. The Battle of Surabaya was fierce and bloody. The freedom fighters and people fought hand in hand till death heroically and many died in the battle. To commemorate their sacrifice, the day when the battle took place was commemorated as the Heroes Day.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>PEMBAHASAN:
</strong></p><p><strong>Orientation  </strong></p><p>On 10 November, Indonesia celebrates Hari Pahlawan or Heroes Day in remembrance of the Battle of Surabaya which started on that very date in the year 1945. The bloody battle took place as Indonesians refused to surrender their weaponry to British army which was part of the Allied forces then. The defiant Bung Tomo is the well-known revolutionary leader who played a pivotal role in this battle.  </p><p><strong>Events  </strong></p><p>It all started due to a misunderstanding between British troops in Jakarta and those in Surabaya, under the command of Brigadier A. W. S. Mallaby. While Brigadier Mallaby already had an agreement with Governor of East Java Mr. Surya that British would not ask Indonesian troops and militia to surrender their weapons, a British plane from Jakarta dropped leaflets all over Surabaya requesting Indonesians to do otherwise on 27 October 1945. This action angered the Indonesian troops and militia leaders because they felt betrayed.  </p><p>On 30 October 1945, Brigadier Mallaby was killed as he was approaching the British troops’ post near Jembatan Merah or Red Bridge, Surabaya. There were many reports surrounding the death but it was widely believed that the Brigadier was murdered by Indonesian militia. Looking at this situation, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison brought in reinforcements in preparation of sieging the city.  </p><p>In the early morning of 10 November 1945, British troops began to advance into Surabaya with cover from both naval and air bombardment. Despite the heroic resistance from the Indonesians, half of the city was conquered within 3 days while the whole battle lasted for 3 weeks. In total, between 6,300 and 15,000 Indonesians died while casualties on the British side are only numbered at about 600.  </p><p><strong>Reorientation
</strong></p><p>Battle of Surabaya caused Indonesia to lose weaponry which hampered the country’s independence struggle. <strong>However, the same battle provoked Indonesian and international mass to rally for the country’s independence which made this battle especially important for Indonesian national revolution.  </strong></p><p>

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p>The passage is about the Battle of Surabaya, a historical battle in Indonesia that took place in 1945.The battle took place on November 10th, 1945.The battle happened in Surabaya, which is located in East Java, Indonesia.The battle was caused by a misunderstanding between the British troops in Jakarta and those in Surabaya, where the British troops dropped leaflets telling the Indonesians to surrender their weapons, despite an agreement made between the British and the Governor of East Java to not ask for the weapons to be surrendered.The passage does not mention any comparison of the Indonesian military power to that of the British army at that time.The Indonesians were provoked to face the British army military aggression as they felt betrayed after the British troops dropped leaflets telling them to surrender their weapons despite an agreement made between the British and the Governor of East Java not to ask for the weapons to be surrendered.The passage does not mention if the Indonesians lost or won the battle, but it states that the city was conquered by the British troops within three days, and that many Indonesians died in the battle.The battle influenced the national revolution at that time by provoking Indonesian and international mass to rally for the country's independence.Bung Tomo is the prominent figure in the battle and he played a very important role in the Battle of Surabaya.November 10th is used as a momentum to commemorate the hero's contribution because it is the anniversary of the Battle of Surabaya, which is considered an important and symbolic event in Indonesia's struggle for independence.<p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p><strong>Apabila Merasa Terbantu Jangan Lupa Bintang 5 nya ya kakak :D</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>JAWAB:</strong></p><p><strong>The Battle of Surabaya (Historical Recount text)</strong></p><p>Indonesia Had gone through many battles why do you think the date of the Battle of Surabaya is used as a momentum to commemorate our hero's contribution?</p><p><strong>Battle of Surabaya provoked Indonesian and international mass to rally for the country’s independence which made this battle especially important for Indonesian national revolution.  The Battle of Surabaya was fierce and bloody. The freedom fighters and people fought hand in hand till death heroically and many died in the battle. To commemorate their sacrifice, the day when the battle took place was commemorated as the Heroes Day.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>PEMBAHASAN:</strong></p><p><strong>Orientation  </strong></p><p>On 10 November, Indonesia celebrates Hari Pahlawan or Heroes Day in remembrance of the Battle of Surabaya which started on that very date in the year 1945. The bloody battle took place as Indonesians refused to surrender their weaponry to British army which was part of the Allied forces then. The defiant Bung Tomo is the well-known revolutionary leader who played a pivotal role in this battle.  </p><p><strong>Events  </strong></p><p>It all started due to a misunderstanding between British troops in Jakarta and those in Surabaya, under the command of Brigadier A. W. S. Mallaby. While Brigadier Mallaby already had an agreement with Governor of East Java Mr. Surya that British would not ask Indonesian troops and militia to surrender their weapons, a British plane from Jakarta dropped leaflets all over Surabaya requesting Indonesians to do otherwise on 27 October 1945. This action angered the Indonesian troops and militia leaders because they felt betrayed.  </p><p>On 30 October 1945, Brigadier Mallaby was killed as he was approaching the British troops’ post near Jembatan Merah or Red Bridge, Surabaya. There were many reports surrounding the death but it was widely believed that the Brigadier was murdered by Indonesian militia. Looking at this situation, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison brought in reinforcements in preparation of sieging the city.  </p><p>In the early morning of 10 November 1945, British troops began to advance into Surabaya with cover from both naval and air bombardment. Despite the heroic resistance from the Indonesians, half of the city was conquered within 3 days while the whole battle lasted for 3 weeks. In total, between 6,300 and 15,000 Indonesians died while casualties on the British side are only numbered at about 600.  </p><p><strong>Reorientation
</strong></p><p>Battle of Surabaya caused Indonesia to lose weaponry which hampered the country’s independence struggle.<strong> However, the same battle provoked Indonesian and international mass to rally for the country’s independence which made this battle especially important for Indonesian national revolution.  </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>
