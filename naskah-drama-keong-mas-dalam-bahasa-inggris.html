Cepet saiki!”  Mbah dukun : “Ngapunten sakderenge putri, nanging wonten punapa saengga kula kedah ngutuk Candra Kirana?”  Dewi Galuh : ”Candra Kirana wes ngrebut Raden Inu Kertapati saka aku, aku ora pengen ngerti Candra kirana dadi bjone Raden Inu Kertapati.”  Mbah Dukun : “Inggih.”  (Ing sawijining dina, ana wong tuwa utawa rondo tuwo sing diarani mbok randha dadapan sing lagi golek iwak nganggo jala ing kali.)  Mbok Randha : “Rasa-rasane dina iki aku pengin mangan iwak. Ah … coba tak golek iwak nang kali nganggo jala, mesthi luwih cepet entuk katimbang nganggo pancing.”  (Saktekane ing kali…)  Mbok Randha : “kira-kira sing akeh iwake ngendi ya?”  (Mbok Randha Dadapan banjur nggolek pakan iwak, supaya iwake pada teka lan gampang dijupuk nggo jala. Nanging dheweke malah nemokake keong kang warnane emas sing nyangkut ing jalane. Keong mas banjur digawa bali karo mbok Randha Dadapan.)  Mbok Randha : “Coba tak kei pakan supaya iwake pada nyerak.

Mbok Randha Dadapan banjur bali menyang ngomah.)  Mbok Randha : “Endi iwake, awet wingi kok ora njedhul-njedhul apa lagi musim jagongan ya, iwake pada njagong, yo wis lah mulih wae.”  (Saktekane ing ngomah Mbok Randha Dadapan kaget amarga neng meja pawone wis ana panganan kang enak-enak dheweke kaget banget.)  Mbok Randha : “We ladalah, saka ngendi tekane panganan iki, sapa sing ngeteri ya?”  (Mbok Randha ngubengi omahe, ora ana wong siji-sijio dheweke tambah bingung mikir asale panganan kuwi.

Mbok Randha Dadapan kaget amarga keong mas sing neng genthong ngerti-ngerti dadi perawan ayu. Perawan mau banjur masak lan nyepakake panganan neng meja. Mbok Randha Dadapan banjur nemoni perawan mau.)  Mbok Randha : “Kowe sapa cah ayu? Kok iso keong alih dadi perawan ayu? Saka ngendi asalmu?”  Candra Kirana : “Kula putri Candra Kirana saking Kraton Daha ingkang disihir dados keong mas dening mbah dukun ingkang kautus dening sedherek kula.”  (Sakwise njawab pitakonan saka Mbok Randha Dadapan, Candra Kirana banjur malih maneh dadi keong mas.

Wah aku kudu goleki dheweke, nanging piye carane ya? Aha…aku membo-membo dadi rakyat wae.”  (Nanging Mbah Dukun krungu menawi Raden Inu Kertapati arep ngoleki Candra Kirana. Dheweke banjur nembo-nembo dadi manuk gagak lan niat nyelakakake Raden Inu Kertapati.)  Mbah Dukun        : “Ihihihih…aku bakal nyelakakake kowe Raden Inu Kertapati.”  (Nalika ana ing tenah ndalan, Raden Inu Kertapati arep goleki Candra Kirana dheweke banjur nembo-nembo dadi manuk gagak lan niat nyelakakake Raden Inu Kertapati.)  Mbah Dukun     : “Raden, panjenengane badhe tindak pundi?”  R.Inu Kertapati : “Aku arep nggoleki Candra Kirana ana apa kowe kok ngalangi lakuku.”  Mbah Dukun     : “Ngapunten Raden, kula badhe nyaosi pirsa bilih Candra Kirana eonten ing tengah alas.”  R.Inu Kertapati : “Apa bener?”  Mbah Dukun     : “Inggih Raden!”  R.Inu Kertapati : “Tak cekel omonganmu!”  (Nalika ana ing tengah alas, Raden Inu Kertapati boten nemokake Candra Kirana.

Then he saw a small hut and approached it. Suddenly he was shocked because he saw his fiancée was cooking through the window. He immediately entered the hut to see her. Finally they were both very happy because they met and the magic was lost. Then the princess told what had happened to her and she also introduced the old woman who had helped her to the prince. The prince was very grateful to the old woman. Then he brought Candra Kirana and the old woman to the palace. After arriving at the palace, the king was happy because her daughter had returned. He also knew what had happened to his daughter. Knowing his sister had been found, Candra Galuh run away from the palace because she was afraid of being punished by his father. Finally Candra Kirana and Raden Inu Kertapati were married and they lived happily ever after.<br />
